A series of basic Data Structures and related algorithms as structures, functions and classes

### Linked List data structure ###

A linked list structure and related methods such as AddToList, PrintList, removeNthItem etc. are created.

### Stack Class ###

A C++ Stack class is created using the above mentioned Linked list structure.

### Future Additions ###
1- More data structures and classes are going to bed added such as Queues, Trees, Binary Trees, Heap etc.
2- Error handling facility will be added to the classes and functions as well as Exception handling.
3- Templates will be used to make the code as generic as possible to be used with varity of data types. It's now mainly typed for Integer int32 data.
4- Cleaner and more descriptive comments will be added
5- Test cases will be added
6- Dynamically allocated memory will be carefully deallocated since there is no Garbage collection in C++
7- That's all for now, i will add more stuff pretty soon! :)
